# Grepolis-Bot by Sebastian
This is a side project alongside studying computer science and mathematics at university, so development can come to some longer breaks eventually.

### Functionality 
The bot itself just controls the game using a webdriver - in my case I'm using the chromedriver - so you can start the bot and still play games, watch Netflix or w/e really. Which is an upgrade compared to my first, second and third bot which needed "full" control of your mouse.

Besides that this bot will eventually feature different - here called - plugins which each in themselfs can have different modes.
The alpha version 0.1.0-aplha currently has one plugin with one basic mode. It's a village farmer that automatically collects all villages every 5 minutes with a small pseudorandom delay.
